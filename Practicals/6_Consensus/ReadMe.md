1. From the set of Genolevures families, select families with exactly one sequence from each of the 9 yeast genomes.

2. Calculate trees for the families of these genes.

3. Calculate the consensus tree from the above set of gene trees.

4. Compare the result with the known species tree topology for this yeast taxas.
